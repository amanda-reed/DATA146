# Introduction

My name is Amanda Reed and I am from Philadelphia, PA. I am currently a freshman at the College of William and Mary and am interested in studying Computer Science or Data Science. I am interested in seeing how Data Science connects with my other interests and the world around us.

This page gives access to my assignments and projects for DATA 146, Intro to Data Science, for the Spring 2021 Semester.
