#### Question 1: Types of Data

Continuous data is numerical and has a range of values. Magnitude is meaningful so arithmetic is often performed on this type of data. For example, age and temperature are both continuous data. Ordinal data can be numerical but has a system of order or rank, so arithmetic is not used on this data. An academic year or place in a race are both examples of ordinal data. Nominal data is categorical and is not represented numerically, but can be for the purpose of making a model. Gender or country are both examples of nominal data; gender could also be represented by 0 and 1.

A model representing life expectancy has features for disposable income, level of education, and gender. Disposable income, which is continuous, will have a coefficient less than 1, but may be an indicator of level of health care. Level of education is represented by ordinal data in varying sets of rank which numerically increases as the level of education increases. Finally, gender, though nominal, can be represented with 0 and 1.
